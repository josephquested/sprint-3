Reflections on Perceivability:

This was a pretty good article that offered a broad overview of the various ways people can percieve information. Much of the content was stuff I more or less had an understanding of, but reading this definitely helped cement some of the concepts in my mind. I hadn't heard of refreshable Braille devices before though. I've been looking into them, they're pretty amazing.

 I think as technology progresses the methods of enchancing perceivability will continue to improve. Until some sort of magical perception device is invented though, using the tools that we currently do have for web development is vital. I'm definitely going to try and make high perceivability a priority for my code in the future.
