USER NEEDS:

Indie Game Players: 
The key demographic to please, they are the ones who will primarily be downloading, commenting on, and potentually paying for games at quested.company. Successfully pleasing this demographic will mostly depend on having a clean, easily navigable website. They should be able to find their way to information and games easily, and of course, the games will need to be enjoyable. But that’s a different issue all together... 

Other Game Designers: 
A big part of achieving success in the indie game community is making connections and participating in the design community. Pleasing this audience will mainly depend on the quality of the blog, as this will be where the majority of the more cerebral content on design and technology will live. And of course, the games (or writing) will need to be of high quality. 

Games Journalists:  
Early in the piece, it is very unlikely that anyone will have any interest in publishing information about quested.company. In the long run, though, it will be important to find a way to cater to the gaming journalist community. Mostly this is through good press kit sections, easily providing information about quested.company, and supplying images or additional marketing content.
